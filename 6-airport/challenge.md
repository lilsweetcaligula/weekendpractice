You are at the airport staring blankly at the arrivals/departures flap display...

![airport flap display](http://www.airport-arrivals-departures.com/img/meta/1200_630_arrivals-departures.png "Airport display")

You notice that each flap character is on some kind of a rotor and the order of characters on each rotor is:

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ?!@#&()|<>.:=-+*/0123456789
```

And after a long while you deduce that the display works like this:

Starting from the left, all rotors (from the current one to the end of the line) flap together until the left-most rotor character is correct.

Then the mechanism advances by 1 rotor to the right...

...REPEAT this rotor procedure until the whole line is updated

...REPEAT this line procedure from top to bottom until the whole display is updated

## Example

Consider a flap display with 3 rotors and one 1 line which currently spells CAT

###Step 1 (current rotor is 1)

    Flap x 1
    Now line says "DBU"

###Step 2 (current rotor is 2)

    Flap x 13
    Now line says "DO)"

###Step 3 (current rotor is 3)

    Flap x 27
    Now line says "DOG"

This can be represented as

```
lines  // array of strings. Each string is a display line of the initial configuration
rotors // array of array-of-rotor-values. Each array-of-rotor-values is applied to the corresponding display line
result // array of strings. Each string is a display line of the final configuration
```
e.g.

```
lines = ["CAT"]
rotors = [[1,13,27]]
result = ["DOG"]
```
## TASK

Given the initial display lines and the rotor moves for each line, determine what the board will say after it has been fully updated.
